		goal: "This Project was written entirely in c++ and is a 2d truss simulator/calculator. The stand alone application allows the user to add points, then connect them to create beams; add loads, supports, and choose a different material. Running the simulation calulates the reaction forces and displacement in each node, aswell as stress/strain within each beam. Additionally it has an interactive GUI with additional other features within it, such as clicking to add nodes or draging and selecting multiple at a time.",
